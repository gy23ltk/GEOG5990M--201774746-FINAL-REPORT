Health is important and at the forefront of many people's minds. This project looks at the effects that green space and wealth has on health, but also, as an extension, the relationship between green space and wealth. Upon a review of 29 papers on health and wealth, Pollack et al. (2007) concluded that, in most cases, higher wealth resulted in higher health. Duncan et al. (2002) also came to a similar conclusion, noting that wealth was a good indicator of mortality. In addition, they also noted that wealth was a better indicator than occupation and schooling. Interestingly, wealth can vary immensely over space. For example, wealth has been shown to vary within ethnic/ racial groups (Braveman et al., 2005), making this an interesting topic to study. Ahmed (2005) observed that home owners, an indicator of wealth, were more likely to engage in leisure time (such as physical activity), increasing health. 
Despite the wide understanding that green space is incredibly important, especially in urban areas (Vereheij, 1996), there has been little research in the UK of this interaction. De Vries et al (2003) found that living in a green environment was positively correlated to health in the Netherlands. These results were supported by Maas et al. (2006) in the Netherlands. Mitchell and Popham conducted a first-of-its-kind study in the UK, showing that greener environments result in lower income deprivation-related health inequalities. Green areas promote recreational activities that have positive effects on health (Powell and Blair, 1994; Westerterp, 2001). This can even lead to lower mortality rates (Takano et al., 2002). Lower levels of poor mental health and salutogenic effects have also been observed as a result of green space (Hartic et al., 2014). This effect is can be so high, to the point that the stress levels can be reduced due to a decrease in blood pressure (Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2003; Pretty et al., 2005) and results in a faster healing process among patients (Ulrich, 1984). The reason for this is hypothesised as greener areas being more expensive, thus attracting wealthier, and therefore, healthier people (Stronks et al, 1993; Mackenbach, 1994).
However, this assumes that there is a correlation between wealth and health too. While this is assumed to be true, there has been little to no studies into it.
